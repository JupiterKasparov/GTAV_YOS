* IsInAngledCube function (yos_utils.pas): originally generated with the help of iAsk.AI
* KillStoryScripts function (yos_worldmanager.pas): originally based on code from GTAV Override by Konijima
* DrawCustomTexture function (yos_screen.pas): oeiginally based on https://github.com/scripthookvdotnet/scripthookvdotnet/blob/f0f86d6e3733b6e8af1fafc37aaf69c8fa9bd03c/source/scripting_v3/GTA.UI/CustomSprite.cs

* All other code from this mod belongs directly to me!

Forks and bug fixes:
If you would like to release bug fixes or improvements (either by forking, or contributing), don't do that.
This is, to keep the mod always compatible with existing savegames and scripts, and not having numerous different incompatible mod versions.
You should do the following instead:
1, Fully finish and thoroughly test your solution before attempting anything!
2, Contact me in a PM or something. Send me your solution (all modified code) in PM.
3, Wait for me to reply!
 * If I don't reply within 3 days, you may send me your PM again...
 * If I don't reply within 3 weeks, you may do a fork, but it'll be potentially incompatible. You should send me a PM with a link to your fork.
 * If I don't reply within 3 months, you may assume I don't maintain this mod aymore! You may do a fork. You should send me a PM with a link to your fork.

And let's see some other 'rules':
* Do not link any external repository to this repository! If you would like to use code, always copy the file to your own repository (and credit me).
* Do not reupload this source code, if this repository is still available!
